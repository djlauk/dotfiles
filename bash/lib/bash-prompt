#
# # Variables for customization
# 
# The bash prompt is customized by the use of environment variables.
# The following variables are used by bash in different situations:
#
# - PS1: interactive prompt
# - PS2: continuation prompt for multi-line commands (default `>`)
# - PS3: used by `select` loop in a script
# - PS4: used in debug mode of a script (enable with `set -x`, default `++`)
# - PROMPT_COMMAND: if set, this command is executed and put in front of PS1
#
#
# # Special character substitution
#
# bash will substitute some characters dynamically. Here's a list of
# the ones I find most important, with a short explanation:
#
# - \e: Start escape sequence, e.g. for color codes
# - \h: Hostname (not full qualified, i.e. foo for host foo.example.com)
# - \H: FQDN (fully qualified host name, i.e. foo.example.com)
# - \t: Time in 24h format HH:MM:SS
# - \u: username of current user
# - \w: full current working directory
# - \W: base name of current working directory
# - \$: Expands to `$` if your not root, or to `#` if you are root.

export PS1='\[\e[0;30;1m\]\W\[\e[m\] $ '
